Implemented Word Checking Game in javascript.

    
1. I created the grid which contain textfield for inputing the text,9 buttons which contains alphabets,refresh button to rotate the buttons and create the new words,and reset button to reset all the text in the textfield.
2. When I input the text in the textfield by creating the word,the word gets checked wheather it is correct or not.If the word is correct then user score will be increased by 1 otherwise user will loose the points.
